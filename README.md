## Output:
```
Instagram and YouTube, though both focused on content sharing, deliver user experiences in different ways.
Instagram emphasizes quick, visually engaging interactions through reels, stories, and posts, supported
by a clean mobile-first layout meant for short usage sessions. YouTube, on the other hand, supports long-form
videos and deep content exploration using playlists, recommendations, and an advanced search system.
While Instagram is strong in instant engagement and social interaction, YouTube excels in content
depth, searchability, and learning-oriented viewing.A combined design strategy—such as Instagram adopting
YouTube’s richer filtering and category-based search,and YouTube integrating Instagram’s smoother navigation and real-time engagement
tools—could improve overall usability.Using Canva-based prototypes, these changes can be visualized
through redesigned navigation bars, improved category tabs,
and a hybrid-style feed that balances quick interaction with detailed content discovery.
